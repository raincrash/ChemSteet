Rendering Proteins and Molecules on AR

An ARKit iOS project for HackInOut 2017 ([Devpost link](https://devpost.com/software/chemstreet))

This is a code bump of scripts, services and IOS Project for HackInOut 2017 submission. Please ignore the shammy code commits.

*EDIT: WE WON!*

## What does the App Do?

The App extracts chemical names from a large text in real-time and renders the molecules/proteins in an AR environment.

- Get real-time text from iOS camera using OCR module (AbbyyRtrSDK.framework).
- Find Chemical compounds/molecules/proteins from text from ML Modules.
  - Wit.AI for processing keywords/traits and extracting entities
  - Locally trained CoreML model instead of Wit.AI (TODO)
- Fetch the chemical name and search for information on ChemSpider 
- The backend service takes a .MOL file containing the molecular data and renders into a 3D scene with OpenGL+PyMOL+MeshTool.
- The rendered .DAE (Collada) files are used to project Chemical formulae on AR Scene (using ARKit) in iOS App.

## ChemSteet iOS App includes

### TextCapture module:
- `AVCaptureSession` is used for preview the iOS Camera layer for text recognition.
- Text recognition is done using [ABBYY Real-Time Recognition SDK](https://github.com/abbyysdk/RTR-SDK.iOS/). 
- On recognition of stable text input from camera & ABBYY SDK, locally it is processed for API request.
- API call for fetching list of chemical elements/molecules/proteins are obtained by Wit.AI backend which helps in mapping local DAE models for ARView.
- On selected chemical to view in AR, AR module is initialised for rendering local DAE model to display on ARView

### AR Module:
- Initialise `ARSCNView` with `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration` for rendering AR model (which in the form of DAE format) for the chemical chosen.
- `renderScene()` render's with geometrical orientation & rotation of the AR model which is mapped for chemical (DAE chemical model present locally in the asset).
- Additional information of the chemical model such as `average_mass, molecular_weight, molecular_formula & common_name` are displayed along the AR model in Scene using `SCNText`

## ChemSteet flask service includes
[`mol_to_deb_service`](https://vast-dusk-78988.herokuapp.com/process/?q=%22It%20reacts%20with%20hydroxyl%20radical%20(%E2%80%A2OH)%20to%20produce%20a%20radical%20intermediate%20%E2%80%A2HOCO,%20which%20transfers%20rapidly%20its%20radical%20hydrogen%20to%20O2%20to%20form%20peroxy%20radical%20(HO2%E2%80%A2)%20and%20carbon%20dioxide%20(CO2)%22) for processing extracted text and serving molecule data from ChalkSteet API.

`mol2dae.workflow` an OSX AppleScript to automate .mol to .dae conversion. (`daes/` has all the extracted Daes files that can be rendered on AR.)

## ChemStreet AI service includes

The entity recognition model etc will be uploaded soon.


## TODO

[ ] Cleanup the project for contributions.

[x] Make a better readme page.
